# Finfy MCP Implementation - Progress Report

## What Has Been Implemented

1. **Basic MCP Architecture**
   - Created MCP client implementation
   - Created MCP server implementation
   - Created integration utilities
   - Created test utilities

2. **MCP Server Features**
   - Implemented `get_context_block` tool
   - Set up Supabase integration for fetching:
     - User profiles
     - Transactions (last 24 months)
     - Account information
   - Implemented context block formatting with Markdown support
   
3. **MCP Client Features**
   - Implemented connection to MCP server
   - Added context retrieval functionality
   - Set up LLM integration with Anthropic Claude
   
4. **External MCP Client Support**
   - Created API endpoint at `/api/mcp`
   - Set up redirect from `.well-known/mcp.json`
   
5. **Chat System Integration**
   - Created example integration with chat system
   - Provided documentation on how to replace the existing `sendChatQuery`

## What Remains To Be Done

1. **Fingoal Integration**
   - Add Fingoal API client once credentials are available
   - Implement user tag retrieval from Fingoal
   - Implement transaction tag retrieval from Fingoal
   - Enhance context formatting to incorporate enriched data
   
2. **Fix Linter Errors**
   - Address TypeScript errors in the MCP server implementation
   - Fix type issues with the MCP client implementation
   
3. **Complete Integration with Chat System**
   - Replace existing `sendChatQuery` in chat slice
   - Initialize MCP during application startup
   - Add cleanup during application shutdown
   
4. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Test the implementation with real user data
   - Verify context generation
   - Test end-to-end with LLM responses
   - Deploy to production
   
5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize context generation for large datasets
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Implement token counting to optimize for model limits
   
## Next Steps

1. **Upon Receiving Fingoal Credentials**
   - Complete the Fingoal integration in `fingoal-integration.ts`
   - Update the MCP server to use Fingoal data
   - Enhance context formatting to highlight enriched insights
   
2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test with the modified chat system
   - Verify responses include enriched financial insights
   - Ensure context is properly truncated for model limits
   
3. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation with Fingoal integration details
   - Add examples of enriched responses
   - Document the API for external MCP clients
