# Yodlee Integration Summary

## Completed Work

We have implemented the Yodlee FastLink 4 integration for Finfy, consisting of:

1. **Webhook Handling**:
   - Created a webhook endpoint at `/api/yodlee/webhook` to receive notifications
   - Implemented handlers for various event types (REFRESH, DATA_UPDATES, etc.)
   - Added a webhook registration endpoint at `/api/yodlee/register-webhook`

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Implemented a data processing endpoint at `/api/yodlee/process-latest-data`
   - Enhanced existing account and transaction saving functionality
   - Set up database tables to store Yodlee data

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Added Yodlee-specific environment variables to `.env.local`
   - Created a setup script for easy initialization (`setup-yodlee.js`)

4. **Database Schema**:
   - Created SQL schema in `supabase/schema-yodlee.sql`
   - Added tables for accounts, transactions, webhooks, and processing status
   - Implemented proper security policies for data access

5. **Documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/YODLEE_INTEGRATION.md`
   - Included troubleshooting tips and testing information

## Next Steps

To complete the integration, follow these steps:

1. **Update Credentials**:
   - Fill in the Yodlee credentials in `.env.local` from the secure link provided
   - Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` for webhook callbacks

2. **Run Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-yodlee
   ```
   This will:
   - Verify your environment configuration
   - Apply the database schema
   - Test the connection to Yodlee
   - Register webhook subscriptions

3. **Configure Webhooks with Yodlee**:
   - Send your webhook URL to Yodlee support: `https://your-domain.com/api/yodlee/webhook`
   - They will set up this URL to receive notifications

4. **Test the Integration**:
   - Use the test credentials provided:
     - Bank: DAG Site
     - Username: YodTest.site16441.2
     - Password: site16441.2
   - Verify that accounts and transactions are saved correctly
   - Check that webhook events are properly processed

5. **Monitor Initial Usage**:
   - Check webhook logs for any issues
   - Monitor data processing status for failures
   - Ensure FastLink is launching correctly

## Configuration Notes

- By default, FastLink is set to use the `LiveConfiguration` config with aggregation mode
- You can modify the FastLink configuration in `src/hooks/useYodlee.tsx`
- Four config modes are available:
  - `aggregation`
  - `verification`
  - `aggregation_and_verification`
  - `verification_and_aggregation`

## Potential Enhancements

For future improvements, consider:

1. Adding a data refresh button for users to manually trigger updates
2. Implementing a status dashboard for integration health monitoring
3. Adding more advanced transaction categorization and analysis
4. Creating a user interface for viewing webhook events and processing status (admin only)
